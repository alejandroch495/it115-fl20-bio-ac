A place to build my bio

I am a emerging professional working on my HTML/CSS/Java script skills in order to become an experienced web page designer/developer for either front end or backend developement. As well as making sure to have clear communications with my team mates and program manger(s). I whenever in a group I try to empower others by giving them helpful ideas to create and then letting them build on those ideas. For instance I had a Professional essay due and I gave everyone a way to explain the topic question with their answers but along the way always asking for their input on certain ideas and seeing them kind of light up with ideas of how to go about the project was great since everyone collaborated consistanly because everyone was included.
